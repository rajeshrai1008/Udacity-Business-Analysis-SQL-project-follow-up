# Udacity BAND SQL follow up project

## Description

This is self-learning project for studying SQL and basic SQL usage in python programming environment.

This is follow up project from the Udacity Business Analytics Nanodegree program (BAND). Original BAND project requires search through Chinook musical store database using DB Browser for SQLite, and student has to submit for review 4 different SQL queries for 4 different questions, and than prepare 4 related visualizations using Google Slides.

In the follow up I prepared a version with slightly different questions, but interactions with Chinook db happen in the python programming environment using sqlite3 module. Results of queries are saved as pandas DataFrame, that allows quickly get a descriptive statistics for quantitative variables. Visualizations are done with seaborn.
